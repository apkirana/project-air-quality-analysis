# Air Quality Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze air quality by exploring the relationship between PM2.5 (fine particulate matter) levels and the Air Quality Index (AQI). Utilizing statistical models, the project quantifies how changes in PM2.5 concentrations affect AQI values, offering insights into the potential health and environmental impacts.

## Key Findings
- **Strong Correlation**: Our analysis reveals a strong positive correlation (0.990) between PM2.5 and AQI, indicating that as PM2.5 increases, the AQI worsens, highlighting significant health risks.
- **Model Performance**: The regression model achieved a high \( R^2 \) score of 0.926, suggesting that 92.6% of the variance in AQI is predictable from PM2.5 levels.
- **Error Metrics**: The modelâ€™s Mean Squared Error (MSE) is 267.578, which means the model predictions are generally close to the actual data points.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For all computational and data processing tasks.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To document and share the project workflow.
- **Libraries**: Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
